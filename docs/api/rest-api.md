# Rest API

For developers that prefer to use a rest API, we have a rest API that you can use to connect to your simulation instance. This API is available at https://intelligentquads.com/sim. You can use this API to start and stop simulations, get information about your simulation instance, and connect to your simulation instance. The rest API is documented at [https://intelligentquads.com/sim/api/v1/docs/redoc](https://intelligentquads.com/sim/api/v1/docs/redoc)
