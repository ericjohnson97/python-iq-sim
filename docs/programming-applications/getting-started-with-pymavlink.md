# Getting Started With Pymavlink

Below is a good intro video for writing a pymavlink script. To run your script with the IQ online simulator just make sure to use UDP port 14551 to avoid conflicting with a ground control station. If you would prefer to us udp port 14550, make sure that there are no already connected ground control stations using that port.
