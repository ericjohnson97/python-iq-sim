# How it works

IQ sim offers simulation infrastructure as a service to help you more quickly develop your application. You can get started in 3 easy steps&#x20;

1.) Configure and start a simulation using the web dashboard&#x20;

2.) Connect to your simulation using the intelligent quads client&#x20;

3.) Connect your application to the simulation via the MAVlink streams generated by the client&#x20;
