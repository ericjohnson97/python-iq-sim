# Start A Simulation

To start a simulation you can use the web UI to configure your simulation. Here you can select your flight controls, vehicle type, version, ect. Once you start a simulation, you will need to download the Intelligent Quads client to connect to the simulation instance you just started in the cloud. From there wou will be able to connect you ground control station and do development as if the simulation was running on your local machine.
